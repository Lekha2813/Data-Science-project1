**Title:** Energy Production Optimization in Combined-Cycle Power Plants

**Business Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to model the energy generated in a combined-cycle power plant as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables. By developing a predictive model, we aim to optimize the plant's performance and enhance its energy production efficiency.


The variables, or features, are the following:

**temperature**, in degrees Celsius.

**exhaust_vacuum**, in cm Hg.

**amb_pressure**, in millibar. (Ambient pressure)

**r_humidity**, in percentage. (Relative humidity)

**energy_production**, in MW, net hourly electrical energy output.
